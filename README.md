# Smart Traffic Control Hub

## Overview
Smart Traffic Control Hub is an innovative prototype designed to revolutionize traffic management in smart cities. Developed by SIGINOV and supervised by Geomatic & GeoIT, this project integrates advanced technologies and cutting-edge methodologies for traffic data processing and analysis.

## Objectives
- To describe the design and implementation of a Smart Traffic Control Hub prototype.
- To improve traffic management in urban settings using real-time data and simulations.

## Key Features
- **Data Setup**: Incorporation of real-time traffic conditions, road closures, and live weather data to enrich traffic simulation.
- **GIS Mapping**: Utilization of Esri's ArcGIS for detailed city mapping including roads, intersections, and traffic flow.
- **Traffic Simulation**: Running traffic simulations using Esri's Network Analyst extension to identify congestion points and suggest optimal traffic signal timings.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Implementation of Apache Kafka and Python for managing real-time traffic data streams.
- **LSTM Model for Congestion Prediction**: Applying a Long Short-Term Memory model to predict traffic congestion ratios, a key indicator for proactive traffic management.

## Components
1. **Road Module**: Structuring road layer with essential information like ID, length, and sensor locations.
2. **Sensor Module**: Using an API to generate random data for entry and exit sensors for dynamic traffic simulation.
3. **User Localization**: Integrating an API for user localization based on their laptop's location for a more personalized experience.
4. **Data Processing**: Aggregating data from APIs, calculating the shortest paths using ArcGIS Network Analyst, and generating optimal route results in JSON format.
5. **Real-Time Data Flow Management**: Simulation and processing of road traffic data using Apache Kafka and Python, ensuring robust and scalable system design.
